# Kiki's Open Source Icon Repository

This repository contains all of the CC0 licensed icons I have created. Each icon comes with a .svg and a .afdesign file, so they can be modified freely by anyone.

## Why do I do this?

As a web and game dev, I have always struggled to find icons for my websites, games, or any other project that I have needed icons for. All of the icon resources I find online either cost money, require attribution, or are otherwise frustrating for me to deal with. As such, I often decide to make my own icons.

The decision to make my icons available for free was partially just because I wanted somewhere convenient that I could store them, but also because I thought it would be nice to have a collection of icons for anyone that doesn't want to deal with the hassle of websites nagging you to pay for their subscription or buy rights just so that you can have the icon in a larger size.

## Future Plans

I have a few fun ideas for this, including but not limited to:

- A GitHub pages website that dynamically loads all of the icons, allowing you to easily look through and download the icons you want.
- Metadata for each icon, allowing for sorting/filtering through icons you don't want.
- More file types, sizes, and fun web-based transformation options (e.g. resizing the canvas, moving icons around, combining multiple icons all in the browser).

If you have any ideas that would be fun/helpful, you can check the [Requesting Changes](https://github.com/Skeats/open-source-icon-set/wiki/Requesting-Changes) page, or if you would like to contribute directly you can check the [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/Skeats/open-source-icon-set/wiki/Contribution-Guidelines)
